* Description :unfold:

*password-menu* is a UI wrapper for the built-in Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html][auth-source]] library.
This package allows you to display auth-source entries in the minibuffer with
either =completing-read= or =transient=. The password for the selected entry is
copied to the kill ring and system clipboard and automatically removed later.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =password-menu.el=, put it in
your =load-path= and =require= it.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package password-menu
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

** Custom key bindings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x j") 'password-menu-transient)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x J") 'password-menu-completing-read)
#+end_src

** [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom]] configuration

*** =packages.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;...
(package! password-menu)
;;...
#+end_src
*** Key bindings
These can be added to =config.el= as shown above.

** Disclaimers

- I have only tested this with Emacs 29.1.
- Testing of the =auth-source= backends was limited to only authinfo.gpg.

* Usage

** Password menus

Menu item entries are formatted with =user@host=.

*** Transient menu

=M-x password-menu-transient=

[[screenshots/password-menu-transient.png]]

This uses a one or two character keyboard selection of entries (transient
prefix). Since the prefix ordering always matches that of the source, this
method is better suited for the use of repeatable discreet key sequences, for
example =C-x j 3=.

*** Completing read menu

=M-x password-menu-completing-read=

[[screenshots/password-menu-completing-read.png]]

Entries are found by scrolling through or searching the list. This is likely
preferable when the list is long.

*** Confirmation message

~Copied password for rnadler@github.com to the kill ring and system clipboard. Will clear in 45 seconds.~

* Customization

Here are the variables that can be customized:
